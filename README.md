# Road DJ (Spotify Remote)

Single-page controller for your Spotify account that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses Spotify's PKCE flow (no client secret on the front end) and lets anyone on the page search, queue, and control playback on your active device.

## What it does
- Connect with Spotify using your account (Premium required for playback control).
- Live now-playing view with artwork and progress.
- Playback controls: play/pause, next, previous, rewind 10s.
- Type-ahead search with forgiving queries; tap a result to queue it.
- Offline-friendly: if the car loses signal, actions are stored locally and replayed when you reconnect.
- Device picker to send commands to a specific active device.

## Quick setup
1) **Add the redirect URI in Spotify Dashboard**  
   - Local dev: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` (main app).  
   - GitHub Pages: `https://<your-gh-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.  
   - Keep your client secret private; the browser only needs client ID + refresh token.

2) **Update the client ID (optional)**  
   - The current client ID in `app.js` is `00c2bd4d6a7e45efbc4a766bf80e54c7`. Replace `CLIENT_ID` at the top if you want to use a different one.

3) **Publish on GitHub Pages**  
   - Create a repo with these files, commit, and push to GitHub.  
   - In Repo Settings → Pages, set Source to the `main` branch root.  
   - Visit `https://<your-gh-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` and click **Connect Spotify**.

## Usage tips
- Open Spotify on your phone or car screen so there's an active device; select it in the dropdown if needed.
- If the page goes offline, queued actions will show in "Pending actions" and send automatically when back online (or tap "Send now").
- To change styling, edit `style.css`; HTML lives in `index.html`, logic in `app.js`.
- For local testing, serve the folder over HTTP (e.g., `python -m http.server 3000`) and add `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` as a Redirect URI in Spotify while testing. The app auto-uses the current page URL for `REDIRECT_URI`; make sure that exact URL is in Spotify.
- If you want to pre-authorize and skip login prompts for guests, run `node fetch_refresh_token.js` (with `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` set) to obtain a refresh token, then paste it into `PREFILLED_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `app.js`. Do **not** commit secrets or refresh tokens to a public repo.

## Notes
- Never commit your client secret to GitHub or expose it on the front end. PKCE avoids needing the secret here; secrets in browser code can be stolen by anyone who opens the page.
- Spotify playback control requires a Premium account and an active device.
- If Spotify Dashboard rejects `http://localhost:8888/callback` as insecure when using `fetch_refresh_token.js`, try `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` instead and set `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` when running the script. Make sure that exact URI is added in the dashboard.
